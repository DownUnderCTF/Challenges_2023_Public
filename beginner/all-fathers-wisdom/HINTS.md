## In order of where they are at ish:
Feel free to adapt these if they are still stuck, you can give the same advise in a different way
or check the solve script and see if you can push them towards one of the stages.


### No Idea where to start:
I heard about those people who are so good at binary they call them a ninja!

### They've started pulling it apart, cannot find important function:
What are you looking for again? Wisdom? Or a Flag? :eyes:

### Found function, wtf do next?
Man that flag function sure has a lot of declarations.. almost like an array of something?

### Found declarations, now what?
What does the ^ operator do in C again?

### Has figured out the array, has HEX, is confused..
Did the challenge say it was gonna be in TEXT, or HEX?.. maybe HEX to TEXT?..

### Cannot HEX TO TEXT?
Cyber Chef sure does make some delicious things.

### At this point I got nothing..
