Hint 1: Look into the type of the format specifiers being used (first argument of the scanf call) compared to the type of the variable (second argument of the scanf call) your input is read into. 
Hint 2: If you're stuck on getting z == -1, look at the _sizes_ of the types of each variable and compare it to the sizes of the types which are being read with the scanf call.
