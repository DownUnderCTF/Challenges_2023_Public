Hint 1: Your input is read as an integer. Integers come in all shapes, sizes, and signs!
Hint 2: The type of idx is an "unsigned short", which ranges from 0 to 65535. What actually happens when an unsigned short is assigned as a negative number? It wraps, so -1 actually becomes 65535. The goal is to somehow make this idx value become 7 by sending a negative number!
