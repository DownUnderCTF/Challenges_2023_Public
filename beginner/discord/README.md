Have you joined our discord yet (https://duc.tf/discord)? 

We have a really helpful support team and lots of other competitors also playing in DUCTF 4.0.

However, the support team are slowly being converted to the way of the monke. So apologies for the delays that might occur because of that. 
  
Why don't you take a listen to the custom hold video the support team made in #rules while you wait for your tickets to be answered.
