============

This is just a fun challenge for people to know where our support line is for the CTF.

For DUCTF 3.0, the support team became obessessed with monke gifs so we decided to bring it back this year for this challenge in DUCTF 4.0.

If you go to our discord (https://duc.tf/discord), and navigate to the #rules channel as referenced in the challenge description.

You will see a video/audio of the custom hold music the team came up with. If you listen to the video/audio, at the end the narrator starts saying the following:

```
DELTA UNIFORM CHARLIE TANGO FOXTROT "LEFT CURLY BRACKET" ROMEO ECHO JULIETT ECHO CHARLIE TANGO HOTEL UNIFORM MIKE ALPHA NOVEMBER INDIA TANGO YANKEE ROMEO ECHO TANGO UNIFORM ROMEO NOVEMBER TANGO OSCAR OSCAR UNIFORM ROMEO SIERRA UNIFORM PAPA PAPA OSCAR ROMEO TANGO QUEBEC UNIFORM ECHO UNIFORM ECHO "RIGHT CURLY BRACKET"
```

The narrator is actually spelling the flag in phonetic alphabet. Translate the phonetic alphabet to regular english alphabet with all captials and no spaces (as referenced in the flag format) and you have solved our discord challenge.

Alternatively, all the phonetic alphabet is at the end of the video and you just have to translate it.
