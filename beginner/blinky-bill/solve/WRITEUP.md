We are provided with blinkybill.wav, an catchy tune that sounds like it has Morse Code overlaid on it

I personally use Audacity when doing any form of Morse Code related challenge as it allows me to clearly visual any spaces between words.

Technical Details: 750hz 17wpm

We end up with the following Morse Code:
-... .-. .. -. --. -... .- -.-. -.- - .... . - .-. . . ...

Upon converting that to plaintext we end up with the FLAG:
BRINGBACKTHETREES
