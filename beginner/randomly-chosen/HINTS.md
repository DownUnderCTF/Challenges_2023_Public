Hint 1: `random.seed` is called with an unkown, but small value which may be bruteforced.
Hint 2: The `random.choices` call is taking random characters from the flag to get the string given in the `output.txt` file. If you know the random seed, you can figure out which random characters it took and reverse the process to unscramble the flag.
Hint 3: Use the flag format (`DUCTF{...}`) to check if your guess for the seed was correct.
