We are given a photo with the description:
What a nice spot to stop,lookout and watch time go by, EXAMINE the image and discover where this was taken.

Instantly attention is drawn to the word EXAMINE as its in capitals, I decided to look at the files EXIF data to see if i could gleam any information from that.

There is multiple ways to view EXIF data but I decided to open up the image in Microsoft Photos.

To view file information(EXIF data) in Microsoft Photos, press ALT+Enter to bring up the Info Menu.

Upon opening the info pane, I was greeted with a bing maps pane with a description of "Yuraygir National Park"

Thats a great start, but the description of "stop,lookout" implied that "Yuraygir National Park" might not be a detailed enough answer. 

The lazy person I am, I decided to google "lookout yuraygir national park" and the first result I was greeted with was the "Durrangan Lookout", after having a scroll through the photos, the 2nd one i came accross looked remarkeably similar to the provided one (https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHGEetl2wwePVIj5TEa5fQreoGdcCKUMW7yG-W=s680-w680-h510).

Following the flag syntax instructions, we end up with the FLAG:
DUCTF{Durrangan_Lookout}
