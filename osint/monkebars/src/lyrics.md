```
Downunder is back at it givin a smack at it
With insane in the brain hacks that hit it
Spit it those facts as we go for a ride
Finding gadgets for a rop and go for a nop slide
Hide away as we go popping brains with our crypto
Elliptical challenges that will make your head blow
Drop a nodoze as you pop a shell and make this app explode

You now the tension and elation
The sensation of hacking through the wire
Desire and admire challenges until you tire
Hack and get on track, we've got codes to crack
Rack your mind while listening to this bad track
D-U-C-T-F left curly bracket smackit-hack-it-drop-that-packet crack-this-track right curly bracket
That's how we whack it yeah \*coughing noises\*

Dropping fat 0days while spitting these mad bars
Ciphers to crack and dipping the cop cars
We are out for muddling and blooding the world
curl our payloads into sites and make them swirl
Thats what the DownUnder crew is going to do
After we are done blasting your mind with something new
So get out with your sisters and bros
Cause no sleep until the unsolved goes
```
