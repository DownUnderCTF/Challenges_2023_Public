  We've been trying to follow our target Faraday but we don't know where he is.

  All we know is that he's somewhere in Victoria and his phone number is +61491578888.

  Luckily, we have early access to the GSMA's new location API. Let's see what we can do with this.

  The flag is the name of the Victorian town our target is in, in all lowercase with no spaces, surrounded by `DUCTF{}`.
  For example, if Faraday was in Swan Hill, the solution would be `DUCTF{swanhill}`.
