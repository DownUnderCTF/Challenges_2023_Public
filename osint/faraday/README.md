_We've been trying to follow our target Faraday but we don't know where he is._

_All we know is that he's somewhere in Victoria and his phone number is +61491578888._

_Luckily, we have early access to the GSMA's new location API. Let's see what we can do with this._

_The flag is the name of the Victorian town our target is in, in all lowercase with no spaces, surrounded by `DUCTF{}`. For example, if Faraday was in Swan Hill, the solution would be `DUCTF{swanhill}`._
