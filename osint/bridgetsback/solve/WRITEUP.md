The bridge is a very distinct bridge so i searched google for "red bridge" on google images and was met with lots of results which would seem to suggest it was the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

I pulled the bridge up on google maps and by focusing on the terrain, I reached the conclusion that it was likely facing towards the city of San Francisco & consequently began to focus my search on lookouts/viewing points near there.

After some time and focusing on the curvature of the road, I came accross the H.Dana Bowers Rest Area

Following the required flag syntax we ended up with:
DUCTF{H._Dana_Bowers_Rest_Area}
