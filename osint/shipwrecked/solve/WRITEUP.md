Shipwrecked
============

A flag within a challenge...Can you work out what that flag is at the bottom right? Hopefully there are enough items to make you think it's naval...seagull and shark ;)

If you worked out the flag is for NSW Marine Rescue then you're off to the races!! Identify the locations and find which one!

What's that? Google Street View is from a long time ago? Luckily someone was nice and uploaded photo in Jan 2022 where you can see the shark through the pole.
