## In order of where they are at ish:
Feel free to adapt these if they are still stuck, you can give the same advise in a different way
or check the solve script and see if you can push them towards one of the stages.


### No Idea where to start:
What is the C installer installer? Where did he find that?

### Still floundering...
Try googling the last word of each line in the description!

### What garbage is this?
Have you read the spec for the 'C' language? refer to hint above.

### I entered the flag and its wrong!
Are you sure its the right flag? Are all the variables what you think they are?

### I can't compile it, where is the C compiler?
C uses chat.openai.com to compile, however as of 2022, it has become too advance for modern AI to compile anymore.

### Do I need to include the '!'?
Look at string interpolation in the 'C' language, do you?

### How do you delete null? wont this crash?
Check the examples page! You can totally delete null! Its the billion dollar mistake remover!


## If they continue to mad struggle for days:

All the examples and explanations for the language can be found at:
https://github.com/TodePond/C 
or by googling DreamBerd and being redirected.

Flag is just in plain text taking advantage of different variable calls and C/Dreamberds weird syntactic shit. I have tried as hard as possible to not have crossover on things that would massively clash so they don't have to consider things like async and scoping and things like assignment vs eqaulity.
