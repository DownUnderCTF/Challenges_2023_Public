Can you perform commands without logging in? What about non-existant commands? What happens then?

Looks like there's a `flag.txt` on the file system but the download functionality seems bugged. Maybe it's already in the FTP's server memory?

Sometimes, FTP commands remind me of functions in how they have a name and take an argument. I wonder if they are implemented the same way?

The description said something about leave a FLAG open to the global internet. Where would a FLAG be so that's it accessible globally?
