Hint 0: The flag is encrypted with the RSA cryptosystem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) whose security is based on the secrecy of the prime numbers p and q. Your goal is to recover those p and q values from the given hints, then you can follow algorithms online to decrypt the flag.
Hint 1: Consider the size of the "a" values -- they are quite small and within range of bruteforce.
Hint 2: Look into the "GCD" algorithm and try to see how it can be used here.
